Spices integration TO-DO:


* [General]
  - Add better error handling
  - Add author info, score on detail popup
  - Expose homepage, other links? from spices (json)
  - Add link interception/handling to detail popup

* Extensions
  - Look into changes required to make extensions uninstallable based on 
    Cinnamon version and extension version. Might also use this for the other
    spices.

* Desklets

* Themes
  - Look into changes required to show full screen screenshots, we kind of need
    to have this option, a tiny screenshot will not be as effective.
